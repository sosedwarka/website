                <i>Our education system needs to prepare our students for a world which is
                        constantly evolving and growing. The Delhi government has established Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Schools
                        of Specialised Excellence to provide an education which is relevant to these ever-changing needs
                        of the 21st Century. These schools are hallmark of an education system which keeps the learning
                        interests and requirements of our students at the centre and prepares them for the dynamic
                        world, outside the school system. </div>
